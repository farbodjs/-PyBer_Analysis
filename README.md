# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project goal was developing a Python-based ride sharing app that is capable of performing analysis on the company's data. 
## Data Sources
We performed our analysis using two major data sets,  1) city data  2)ride data . Both of these data sets were CSV files provided by the Ride sharing company.
## Deliverables
- A bubble chart displaying the average fare vs the total number of rides (per city)

- A box-and-whisker plot showing the number of rides for each city type in 2019.

## Summary
1) After analyzing ride sharing data for three city types (rural, urban, and suburban) it is understood that the total number of rides is the most in urban areas, and is the least in rural areas. 
2) Urban areas has more drivers than rural and suburban areas.
3) The reason for having higher fares in rural and suburb areas compared to urban areas, is to make up the profit loss due to fewer number of rides. This shows that trips are shorter and cost less in urban areas and it results in high number of drivers.
